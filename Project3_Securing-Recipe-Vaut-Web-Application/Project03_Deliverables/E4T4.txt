Problem-01: # What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Solution-01:
1. We should block SSH logon to all EC2 instances and disable SSH logon altogether.
2. We should all ports to the internet opened for all EC2 instances. Important internal access can only be allowed thorugh different Security groups as per the requirement of the project architecture.

Problem-02: # Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Solution-02:
Creating VPC private endpoints would help to make the network communication faster and cheaper as data travel only within the AWS network and it does not require to make use of the internet gateway to route though the private IP. 
As per the current project architecture, secert recepies need to be accessed from the public network so short answer would be "NO".

Problem-03: # Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Solution-03:
No, applying the default encryption to the S# bucket will not encrypt the alreadly present information in the S3 bucket.It can only encrypt the new objects added to the S3 bucket.

Problem-04: # What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Solution-04: Cloud formation will over right all the changes and project architecture would be back to the original state. Only solution is to do the necessary changes in the "cloud formation" templates if we want to persist the code changes.
