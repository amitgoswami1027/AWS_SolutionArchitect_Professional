Problem: # Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
Solution:
1. SSH port should not be open to all 0.0.0.0/0. If we can restrict the SSH port so that outside entity should not be able to connect to the instance over SSH, it will help to 
make our EC2 instances secure.
2. Security Group need to be changed and should only allow restricted access as per the least privilage policy.
3. Disable SSH password login on the application server instance.

Problem: # Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access 
to sensitive data.
Solutions:
Need to follow the least privilage policy. Security groups need to be fine tuned to be able to access the S3 buckets with Free Recipes.
