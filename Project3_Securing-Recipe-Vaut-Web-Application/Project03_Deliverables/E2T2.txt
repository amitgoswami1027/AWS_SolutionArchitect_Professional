Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Security Hub Highlight some of the following top security vulnerabilities:
HIGH
2.1 Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
CloudTrail.1 CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-region trail
4.2 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

MEDIUM
IAM.7 Password policies for IAM users should have strong configurations
2.9 Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
IAM.5 MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have console password
ELBv2.1 Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
SSM.1 EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager
S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled

LOW
API EnableSecurityHub was invoked using root credentials.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Setting the appropiate IAM policy, do not use root user, create a child user and set the IAM policices for not allowing root user.
2. Streamling the network communication between the entities by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS requests.
3. Security Groups should be streamline and should not allow everything. 
4. EC2 instance security groups should be alligned to only allow traffic from the specific entities as required.
5. Enable VPC Flowlogs and s3 Bucket logging.
6. TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance.
